CSV file contains 500K records of two fields as shown below.
1. Userid(unique)
2.username
If userid matches in that data csv, the out put was userid and username in separate CSV file , doesn't match only remaining userid into the separate CSV.
W.A.P to Find Matches and unMatches from data.csv with findings.csv using pandas?
